* ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Joseph Moyalan and I am a PhD student at the Mechanical Engineering Department of Clemson University with a focus on Dynamics and Control systems.
* ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in optimization and optimal control of nonlinear systems.
* ðŸŒ± My current projects involve data-driven control of nonlinear systems for safety and convergence. This involves the use of the density function from measure theory to provide a convex formulation for optimal control problems in the function space. My other projects involve the safe navigation of complex nonlinear systems using control density functions.
* ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on machine learning implementation for control of real-world examples like robotics, vehicle dynamics, and navigation.
* ðŸ”­ To look at my recent publications, please visit my Google Scholar page [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=smwttLYAAAAJ&hl=en).
